Creative Souls is a hypothetical Victorian organization funding a range of creative projects including Movies, TV Series, Games and other creative contents. They provide funds and incentives to content creators, with the intention of increasing the production expenditure and employments in Victoria as a whole, as well as in the regional Victoria. They have annual targets for these key measures, and would like to see their performance in quarterly and annual formats. Return on Investment is another KPI they are keen to monitor over the time. They aspire to support an increasing number of creative project types, and prioritizes the projects from the Victorian creators.

The Senior Management of Creative Souls would like a single report where they can see the organization's performance over the time. They would evaluate whether their operations and decisions were aligned with the organization's strategy, and would draw further actions based on the insights delivered by this report.
